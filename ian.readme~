no way ahaha

1. Command line for rosetta ligand docking

if docking is done with rosetta_svn version

'rosettag.gcc sp 1pro _ -dock -use_input_sc -ligand -dock_mcm -nstruct 1500 -dock_pert 3.0 3.0 75 -ex1 -ex1aro -ex2 -output_input_pdb -l startstructslist -fa_input -fa_output -read_all_chains -try_both_his_tautomers'

when flexible ligand running: -flexible_ligand -ligand_mdlfile $file

#general options in command line, work with all modes
-use_input_sc
-ex1 -ex1aro -ex2 -ex2aro  increase rotamer library
-l starting structure list
-s starting structure
-try_both_his_tautomers
-read_all_chains 

probably
-fa_input full atom mode 
-fa_output outputs full pdb coords

#docking options
-dock: tells it to go into dock mode
-ligand: switches ligand on

three dock parameters: -dock_min -dock_mcm -dock_pert
dock_min: does rigid body minimization of ligand
dock_mcm: does monte carlo moves with ligand. when converges, does dock_min 
dock_pert num1 num2 num3

if dock_pert: at the start of each run, the ligand gets perturbed randomly to a new position. at that position, a dock_mcm protocol is called.
num1: ligand gets perturbed a random 0<distance<num1 on the axis connecting ligand and protein centers of mass 
num2: ligand gets perturbed a random 0<distance<num2 in the plane perpendicular to the first perturbation axis and intersecting it at the first perturbation point
num3: ligand gets rotated a random 0<ang<num3

first two strings, i.e. 'sp 1pro _' : heritage  



the first 2 parameters (sp 1pro) are naming options, i.e. their values will appear in the output files. the third parameter ( _ ) means that all chains of the protein are considered. 
the three '-dock_pert' parameters mean the following: the first value is the maximum angstrom value that the ligand is moved (perturbed) along the docking normal, it will be moved a random distance between 0 and the given value. the second parameter is the maximum distance that the ligand is moved in the docking parallel from the initial perturbed position along the docking normal. the third parameter is the maximum number of degrees the ligand is rotated in its final perturbed position.

for the kemp ligand and with 3.0 3.0 75 as -dock_pert parameters, producing 1000-1500 decoys should give enough sampling. if larger values are used, the value for '-nstruct' should be increased correspondingly.
it is hard to guess what a suffiecient number of decoys is for any given system and dock_pert parameters, one possible strategy to get a clue about this is to generate an extremely huge amount of decoys for one test system and then look at how many decoys are at least necessary to make the scatter plot qualitatively resemble the plot of all decoys.
